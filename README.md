Learning from Others: I value the expertise of my peers and believe that mentorship and feedback are the fastest ways to grow.

Tact & Diplomacy: I strive to build technical solutions that balance user needs with system requirements through clear communication.

Empathy in Tech: I’m focused on moving beyond solo work to embrace cooperation, compromise, and shared success.
