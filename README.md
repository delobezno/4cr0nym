# Hi there, I'm 4cr0nym! 👋

👨‍💻 About Me
I am an IT enthusiast passionate about automation and process optimization. In my current role, I focus on transforming repetitive daily tasks into efficient, automated workflows using native system tools.

Current Focus: Mastering VBA for Excel and PowerShell automation to deliver immediate business value.

Learning Journey: Exploring the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build clean, browser-based interfaces.

Future Goals: Deepening my knowledge in SQL and Python to elevate test automation strategies.

🤝 My Approach: Collaboration & Growth
For me, software development is as much about people as it is about code. I am actively working on my social and emotional intelligence to become a better collaborator and partner:

Learning from Others: I value the expertise of my peers and believe that mentorship and feedback are the fastest ways to grow.

Tact & Diplomacy: I strive to build technical solutions that balance user needs with system requirements through clear communication.

Empathy in Tech: I’m focused on moving beyond solo work to embrace cooperation, compromise, and shared success.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools (Native Environment Specialist)
Specializing in "no-install" environments, I maximize the potential of pre-installed tools and browser-based development:

Languages: VBA (Office), PowerShell (Windows), JavaScript (Browser).

Web: HTML5, CSS3.

Logic: SQL & Data Structure Analysis.

📫 Let's Connect
I am always open to feedback on my projects or a chat about best practices in automation.

Guiding Principle: "Relationships are my best teachers."

Case Study 1: Test Automation for Enterprise Storage Systems

Focus: Python & System Integrity (based on experience at Fujitsu)

Challenge: Ensuring the high availability of enterprise storage systems during physical channel interruptions (multipath). Manual testing was too time-consuming and error-prone due to the complexity of the I/O scenarios.

Technical Implementation:

Automation: Development of modular test scripts in Python to simulate failover scenarios and load tests.

Infrastructure Reconfiguration: Automated reconfiguration of device connections to validate system stability under stress conditions.

Framework: Integration of the test logic into the SEM system for continuous monitoring of I/O performance.

Result: Significant increase in test coverage for critical failure scenarios and reduction of manual test cycles through a robust, automated pipeline. +1

Case Study 2: Performance Optimization of Desktop Applications

Focus: Java 21 & Database Systems (based on work at Jus-IT/LDBV)

Challenge: Analyzing and processing large, complex datasets within a desktop environment while simultaneously meeting high performance standards for stakeholders.

Technical Implementation:

Modern Java: Implementing efficient logic using Java 21 to leverage modern language features for data processing.

Database Layer: Optimizing queries and data analysis using Oracle SQL to minimize latency in communication between the application and the backend.

Code Quality: Conducting systematic code reviews within the team to ensure the maintainability and scalability of the architecture.

Result: Delivering a high-performance desktop solution that accurately and promptly meets the complex analysis requirements of stakeholders.
